You can talk to us on Gitter and Matrix, tweet at us on Twitter or create a new topic in the Solidity forum. Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!

Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

For a good overview and starting point, please check out the official [Solidity Language Portal](https://soliditylang.org).

## Building on MacOS

You likely need to install Xcode. If you don't want to install Xcode you can try `xcode-select --install`

**Install dependencies**:

```shell
brew install cmake boost ccache
```

**Accept Xcode license without launching GUI**:

```shell
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

**Clone and navigate to SolidityX directory**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/SolidityX.git && cd SolidityX
```

**Run build script**:

```shell
# note: this will install binaries solc and soltest at usr/local/bin
./scripts/build.sh
```

**Running**:

```shell
solc --pretty-json --bin --asm test.sol
```

## Building on Ubuntu 22.04

**Update and upgrade**:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Install dependencies**:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev
```

**Clone and navigate to SolidityX directory**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/SolidityX.git && cd SolidityX
```

**Create and navigate to build directory**:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
```

**Build and install**:

```shell
cmake .. && make
```

## Background

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer
network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow anyone to implement tokens of value,
ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of
Solidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug fixes, are
introduced regularly. We currently use a 0.x version
number [to indicate this fast pace of change](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## Build and Install

Instructions about how to build and install the Solidity compiler can be
found in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).

## Example

A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;
contract ETX {
    constructor() public payable {
        bool result;
        assembly {
            result := etx(
                0,                                          // temp variable, can be anything (unused)
                0x5A457339697CB56E5a9BfA5267eA80d2c6375d98, // address to send to
                500000000000000000,                         // amount to send in wei
                100000,                                     // gas limit (entire gas limit will be consumed and sent to destination)
                1,                                          // miner tip in wei
                1,                                          // base fee in wei
                0,                                          // input offset in memory
                0,                                          // input size in memory
                0,                                          // accesslist offset in memory
                0                                           // accesslist size in memory
            )
        }
        // do something with the result
    }
}
```

To get started with Solidity, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is a
browser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:

1. [Voting](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#voting)
2. [Blind Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
3. [Safe remote purchase](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase)
4. [Micropayment Channel](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)

## Documentation

The Solidity documentation is hosted using [Read the Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org).

## Development

Solidity is still under development. Contributions are always welcome!
Please follow the
[Developers Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html)
if you want to help.

You can find our current feature and bug priorities for forthcoming
releases in the [projects section](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects).

## Maintainers

The Solidity programming language and compiler are open-source community projects governed by a core team.
The core team is sponsored by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/).

## License

Solidity is licensed under [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE.txt).

Some third-party code has its [own licensing terms](cmake/templates/license.h.in).

## Security
